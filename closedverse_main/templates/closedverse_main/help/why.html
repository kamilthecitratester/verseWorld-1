    <h2 class="label">Why?</h2>
    <div id="guide" class="help-content">
      <div class="faq">
		
		<p><i>Why</i>: Adverb, conjunction.</p>
		
		<h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
		<p>Every other Miiverse clone sucked (look at the FAQ), and if they didn't, then they were made with spaghetti. Discord guilds won't cut it either, and anyone could make those, they're unoriginal and suck. Also, I need money.</p>
		<h2>Why should I join?</h2>
		<p>Well, we have..</p>
		<ul>
		<li>No post limit, duh</li>
		<li>No over-protective rules made to conform to 7 year olds, duh</li>
		<li>The ability to do what you want, duh</li>
		<li>Friend requests and messaging! Activity Feed posting!</li>
		<li>Post editing! You can draw on PC!!!!!!!!!!</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse">Open-source!</a> Make yourself a pizza pasta.</li>
		<li>Miiverse users. You know, the ones you know and love.</li>
		<li>This works after Miiverse shuts down. That is, if Nintendo doesn't shut down their Miis server. Please do not do that Nintendo thanks bye also don't sue me.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?</h2>
		<p>Okay, so</p>
		<ul>
		<li>At the moment (as of writing this, November 4th 2017, hey there!), there isn't a block/report function &#58387;</li>
		<li>But that doesn't mean that we don't have ANY admins though.</li>
		<li>Sometimes, it's slow. Other times, it's fast. It varies.</li>
		<li>The owner has school.</li>
		<li>Is this even legal?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However...</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Since we have so many Miiverse users here, and we have completely free sharing of online accounts, you can search for one of your favorite users and hopefully they have something on their profile!!!!!!</li>
		<li>If you make your nickname &lt;= 2 characters long and your username short and never Yeah or comment or post anything and tell your friends to do the same, you can have a completely private account!!!</li>
		<li>This is developing. Even though nobody has made a pull request, anyone could commit to this if they really wanted to. ANYONE.</li>
		<li>Even if this fails, you know the code is public. Who knows what someone might do with it? What will YOU do with it? Don't give me the "I don't know progamming!!!!!" answer, you can learn Python 3 easily. Trust me, I know.</li>
		<li>I'm committed. Don't think I'll not do anything about a problem, I'm always here. (unless I'm on vacation or something)</li>
		</ul>
        
		<h2>Can I use this on 3DS?!?!?!?</h2>
		<p>I don't know. If you're talking about having it natively, <b>no.</b> The reason for this and everything else, why we don't have games support, is simple: <i>this is only meant to replicate the Miiverse side of Miiverse.</i> I mean that I have no intention at the moment to bring back any game compatibility, or porting this to the native 3DS/Wii U applications. I could do it with time, but I just do not feel like it.</p>
		
		<h2>What's the point? Why and how has humanity lead to this?</h2>
		<p>Again, I myself am not really pushing this for anything. Again, this was made for fun, and the Miiverse community + users. Forums meant to replicate Miiverse are usually pretty terrible and not in the same format, and other social networks either have their kinks (Twitter, GAB, whatever else).</p>
		
		<h2>Lol no.</h2>
		<p>If you don't want to join, sure! Nobody is pushing you to anything. If you wish to learn anything about how to make a basic forum-type application in Django, you could glance at my source and learn from it, or you could start learning Python's syntax in general.<br>As I've said again, you can just have this as a gateway, as you can put any profile you want here.</p>
		
		<h2>Who even are you?</h2>
		<p>Probably the owner. I don't know, this is <a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse/blob/master/closedverse_main/templates/closedverse_main/help/why.html">hardcoded into the thing</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Why are you so happy?</h2>
		<p>I'm feeling like it today.</p>
		
		<h2>Can I translate this into my language?</h2>
		<p>No. <s>(t yet)</s></p>
